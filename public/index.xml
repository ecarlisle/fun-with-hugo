&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;strong&gt;The Dude&lt;/strong&gt; Lebowski is mistaken for a millionaire Lebowski, two thugs urinate on his rug to coerce him into paying a debt he knows nothing about. While attempting to gain recompense for the ruined rug from his wealthy counterpart, he accepts a one-time job with high pay-off. He enlists the help of his bowling buddy, Walter, a gun-toting Jewish-convert with anger issues. Deception leads to more trouble, and it soon seems that everyone from porn empire tycoons to nihilists want something from The Dude.&lt;/p&gt;
