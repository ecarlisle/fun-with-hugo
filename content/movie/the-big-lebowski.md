## Plot
When <strong>"The Dude"</strong> Lebowski is mistaken for a millionaire Lebowskeai, two thugs urinate on his rug to coerce him into paying a debt he knows nothing about. While attempting to gain recompense for the ruined rug from his wealthy counterpart, he accepts a one-time job with high pay-off. He enlists the help of his bowling buddy, Walter, a gun-toting Jewish-convert with anger issues. Deception leads to more trouble, and it soon seems that everyone from porn empire tycoons to nihilists want something from The Dude.

## My Obervations
1. All the protagonists are bowlers.
2. All the antagonists are artists.
3. Like in Roadhouse, Sam Elliott is awesome!
